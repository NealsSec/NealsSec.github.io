# About me

I am Neals, I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Cyber Security and this
Github website is essentially dedicated to my writeups and other research.

I am mostly focused on Reverse Engineering, Pwn and other Vulnerability analysis
and research both hardware and software samples.

# Writeups and Research

This space is under construction as I'm not ready to release a writeup for any of
my software projects.

## CTF

This space is reserved for when I writeup some CTF challenges.
