# About me

I am Neals, this Github website is dedicated to my writeups and other research.

I am mostly focused on Reverse Engineering, Exploitation and other Vulnerability Research
on both hardware and software samples.

If you wish to contact me my email is <NealsSec@protonmail.com>

# Writeups and Research

## Software

* [Cave Heroes](./writeups/RE/software/CaveHeroes/CaveHeroes.md)

## Hardware

* [Netis Router](./writeups/RE/hardware/netis/netis.md)

# Projects

I mostly work in C and Python making small tools to develop my programming skills.

* [Overflow](https://github.com/NealsSec/OverflowProject) - This is a project that
outputs x amount of letters in a pattern. This makes hunting for buffer 
overflows and the offsets for code injection a little bit easier due to the easily 
recognizable pattern.
