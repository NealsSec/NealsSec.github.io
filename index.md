# About me

I am Neals, I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Cyber Security and this
Github website is essentially dedicated to my writeups and other research.

I am mostly focused on Reverse Engineering, Pwn and other Vulnerability analysis
and research both hardware and software samples.

# Writeups and Research

## Software

This space is under construction as I'm not ready to release a writeup for any of
my software projects.

## Hardware

* [Netis Router](./writeups/RE/hardware/netis/netis.md)

* [TPLink Smart Switch](./writeups/RE/hardware/tplink/tplink.md)

## CTF

This space is reserved for when I writeup some CTF challenges.

## Malware

* [Olympic Destroyer](./writeups/Malware/olympicdestroyer/olympic.md)

# Projects

I mostly work in C and Python making small tools to develop my skills in the
languages.

* Overflow - This is a private project that I will make public within a month or two
it is basically a program that outputs x amount of letters and make hunting for
buffer overflows a little bit easier.

* [BBMP](https://github.com/Blizire/bbmp) - This is a collaboration project to help
better learn C while creating some interesting 'art' in the process.
