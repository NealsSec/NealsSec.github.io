# About me

I am Neals, I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Cyber Security and this
Github website is essentially dedicated to my writeups and other research.

I am mostly focused on Reverse Engineering, Pwn and other Vulnerability analysis
and research both hardware and software samples.

If you wish to contact me my email is <NealsSec@protonmail.com>

# Projects

I mostly work in C and Python making small tools to develop my skills in the
languages.

* Overflow - This is a private project that I will make public within a month or two
it is basically a program that outputs x amount of letters and make hunting for
buffer overflows a little bit easier.

* [BBMP](https://github.com/Blizire/bbmp) - This is a collaboration project to help
better learn C while creating some interesting 'art' in the process.
