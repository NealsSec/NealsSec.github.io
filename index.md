# About me

I am Neals, I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Cyber Security and this
Github website is essentially dedicated to my writeups and other research.

I am mostly focused on Reverse Engineering, Pwn and other Vulnerability analysis
and research both hardware and software samples.

If you wish to contact me my email is <NealsSec@protonmail.com>

# Writeups and Research

## Software

* [Cave Heroes](./writeups/RE/software/CaveHeroes/CaveHeroes.md)

* [Jet Island](./writeups/RE/software/Jetlands/JetIsland.md)

* [H3VR Scoreboard](./writeups/RE/software/H3VR/H3VR.md)

## Hardware

* [Netis Router](./writeups/RE/hardware/netis/netis.md)

## CTF

This space is reserved for when I writeup some CTF challenges.

## Malware

* [Olympic Destroyer](./writeups/Malware/olympicdestroyer/olympic.md)

# Projects

I mostly work in C and Python making small tools to develop my skills in the
languages.

* [Overflow](https://github.com/NealsSec/OverflowProject) - This is basically a
program that outputs x amount of letters and makes hunting for buffer overflows
a little bit easier. Once finished, this project should be able to overflow a buffer
and overwrite the return pointer with a supplied address to make for easy exploitation.

* [BBMP](https://github.com/Blizire/bbmp) - This is a collaboration project to help
better learn C while creating some interesting 'art' in the process. This project is
a library to help create bmp images by leveraging the bmp specification.
